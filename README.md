# 🌱 SproutSense - AI-Powered Student Assessment Platform

**Comprehensive student assessment and analysis platform for teachers and students with AI-powered insights.**

SproutSense is a modern web application that enables teachers to assess students and provides AI-powered analysis for personalized learning insights, career guidance, and development plans. The platform supports two distinct assessment types based on grade levels and provides comprehensive analytics dashboards.

## ✨ Key Features

### For Teachers
- 📝 **Dual Assessment Types**:
  - **Questionnaire Assessment** (LKG - Grade 2): Rate students on various parameters (1-5 scale)
  - **Marks Assessment** (Grade 6+): Enter subject marks and assess 5 key factors (conceptual understanding, recall, logical reasoning, attempts bonus questions, effort)
- 🔑 **Unique Report Codes**: Generate unique codes for each assessment that students can use to access their reports
- 📊 **Comprehensive Dashboard**: View all student reports, track assessment history, and manage multiple students
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Analysis**: Automatic analysis of student performance with detailed insights

### For Students
- 🔐 **Simple Access**: Enter name and report code provided by teacher to access reports
- 📈 **Detailed Analytics**: View comprehensive analysis including:
  - Overall performance (strengths & improvement areas)
  - Subject-wise performance breakdown
  - Career recommendations with suitability scores
  - Stream suggestions
  - Study recommendations and strategies
  - Learning profile insights
  - Development plan (immediate actions, short-term goals, long-term objectives)
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Access reports on any device

## 🎯 Assessment Types

### Early Childhood (LKG - Grade 2)
Teachers fill out a questionnaire rating students on various parameters using a 1-5 scale. The system analyzes responses and provides insights into:
- Cognitive development
- Linguistic skills
- Mathematical understanding
- Visual-spatial abilities
- Attention and focus
- Memory capabilities
- Processing speed

### Grade 6 and Above
Teachers enter:
- **Subject Marks**: Obtained marks and total marks for each subject
- **5-Factor Assessment** (1-5 scale):
  - Conceptual Understanding
  - Recall
  - Logical Reasoning
  - Attempts Bonus Questions
  - Effort (Non-Conservative Approach)

The system sends this data to an AI analysis API that provides:
- Subject-wise analysis with grades and percentages
- Parameter analysis for each subject
- Overall performance metrics
- Career guidance and stream suggestions
- Personalized study recommendations
- Development plans

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Clerk account for authentication
- Convex account for database
- (Optional) Resend account for email functionality

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key

# Convex Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_url
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=your_convex_deploy_key

# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Email (Optional)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

### 3. Set Up Clerk Authentication

See [CLERK_SETUP.md](./CLERK_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

Quick setup:
1. Create a Clerk account at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
2. Create a new application
3. Add your API keys to `.env.local`
4. Configure redirect URLs in Clerk dashboard

### 4. Set Up Convex Database

1. Install Convex CLI: `npm install -g convex`
2. Run `npx convex dev` to initialize Convex
3. The schema and functions are already defined in `convex/schema.ts` and `convex/functions.ts`
4. Convex will generate the API types automatically

### 5. Set Up External AI Analysis API

The application integrates with an external AI analysis API. Ensure the API endpoint is accessible:
- Base URL: `https://7fg18gc3-8000.uks1.devtunnels.ms/api/v1`
- The API is accessed via Next.js API proxy routes to handle CORS

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

## 📊 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Teacher Registration/Login**
   - Teacher signs up/logs in via Clerk
   - Completes onboarding (accepts terms, provides basic info)
   - Accesses Teacher Dashboard

2. **Creating Assessments**
   - Teacher selects student grade level
   - For LKG-Grade 2: Fills out questionnaire (1-5 scale for each question)
   - For Grade 6+: Enters subject marks and rates 5 assessment factors
   - System generates unique report code
   - Assessment data is sent to AI analysis API (for Grade 6+)
   - Results are stored in Convex database

3. **Student Access**
   - Student signs up/logs in via Clerk
   - Completes onboarding (enters name and report code)
   - System links report code to student account
   - Student accesses Student Dashboard to view all reports with that code

4. **Viewing Analytics**
   - Students see comprehensive analysis including:
     - Subject performance breakdown
     - Overall strengths and improvement areas
     - Career recommendations
     - Study recommendations
     - Learning profile
     - Development plan

### Data Flow

```
Teacher Input → Convex Database → AI Analysis API → Stored Results → Student Dashboard
```
